    "Binary serach is a search algorithm that runs in $O(logn)$ in the worst case, where $n$ is the size of the search space.\n",
    "\n",
    "For binary search to work, your search space $n$  usually needs to be sorted. Binarcy search trees and graphs are based on binary search. Normally, binary search is done on an array of sorted elements, but you can use binary search in a more creative ways as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If we have an array `arr` of sorted element `x`, then in $O(log n)$ time complexity and $O(1)$ space complexity, binary search can:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) find the index of `x` if it in `arr`\n",
    "2) find the first or the last index, in which `x` can be inserted to maintain being sorted otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the search space is halved everytime, binary search's worse case time complexity is $O(log n)$. This makes it an extremely powerful algorithm as logarithmic time is **very** fast compared to linear time.\n"
