    "**Note**: earlier, we said that the depth of the root is `0`. **This is the usual definition**, but in this specific problem, the `depth for the root is defined as 1` (it's asking for how many nodes are on the path from the root to a leaf), and `we need to include the root on this path`, hence why we start at `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The problem states that we are looking for a path from the root to a leaf, which means that at the current node, we can only consider either the left or right subtree, not both. If `maxDepth(node.left)` represents the maximum depth of the left subtree and `maxDepth(node.right)` represents the maximum depth of the right subtree, then we should take the greater value and **add 1 to it** (because the current node contributes `1` to the depth).\n",

Whatever that path is, we can just follow it to give us an answer of `1 + maxDepth(root.left)`. The same logic applies to `maxDepth(root.right)`. We should choose the maximum length between the two children.\n",
    "\n",
    "- So how does this actually work in the code? We initially call `maxDepth(root)`, where root is the actual root of the tree. DFS will move down the tree until it reaches a leaf. **A leaf has no children**, so both calls to the left and right will hit the base case and return `0`. **This makes the call to the leaf return** `1 + max(0, 0) = 1`.\n",
