    "2) Space complaxity - the amount of memory allocated by the algorithm relative to input size\n",

    "**Typically, people care about the time complexity more than the space complexity, but both are important to know**.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are some common assumptions that we make. Wehen dealing with integers, the larger t he integer, the more time operations like addition, multiplication or printing will take. While this **is** relevant in theory, we typically ignore this fact because the difference is practically very small, and treat all integers the same. If you are given an array of integers as an input, the only variable you would ues is _n_ to denote the length of the array. Technically, you could introduce another variable, let's say _k_ which denotes the average value of the integers in the array. However, nobody does this. \n",

For example, we could have a problem where the input is two arrays. _n_ could denote the length of one while _m_ denotes the length of the other.\n",

    "**Calculating complexity**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the above example (find the largest number in `nuums`), we have a time complexity of **O(n)**. The algorithm involves iterating over each elements in `nums`, so if we define _n_ as the length of `nums`, ou algorithm uses approximately _n_ steps. If we pass an array with a length of `10`, it will perform approximately `10` steps. If we pass an array with a length of `10,000,000,000`, it will perform approximately `10,000,000,000` steps. \n",

    "- Being able to analyze an algorithm and calculate it's time and space complexity is a crucial skill. Interviewers will **almost always** ask you for your algorithm's complexity to check that you actually understand your algorithm and didn't just memorize/copy the code. Being able to analyze an algorithm also enables you to determine what parts of it can be improved. \n",

    "**Rules**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few rules when it comes to calculating complexity. First, **we ignore constants**. That means $O(9999999n) = O(8n) = O(n) = O(\\frac{n}{500})$. Why do we do this? Imagine you had two algorithms. Algorithm A uses approximately _n_ operations and algorithm B uses approximately _5n_ operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "When _n_ = 100, algorithm A uses 100 operations and algorithm B uses 500 operations. What happens if we double _n_ ? Then algorithm A uses 200 operations and algorithm B uses 1000 operations. As you can see, When we double the value of _n_, both algorithms require double the amount of operations. If we were to _10x_ the value of _n_, then both algorithms would require _10x_ more operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember: the point of complexity is to analyze the algorithm **as the input changes**. We don't care that algorithm B is _5x_ slower than algorithm A. For both algorithms, as the input size increases, the number of operations required increases **linearly**. That's what we care about. Thus, both algorithms are **O(n)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The second rule is that we consider the complexity as the variables **tend to infinity**. When we have additions/subtraction between terms of the **same variable, we ignore all terms except the most powerful one**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, $O(2^{n} + n^{2} - 500) = O(2^{n})$. Why? Because as _n_ tends to infinity, $2^{n}$ becomes so large that the other two terms are effectively zero in comparison. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that we had an algorithm that required _n_ + 500 operations. It has a time complexity of $O(n)$. When _n_ is small, let's say n = 5, the +500 term is very significant - but we don't care about that. We need to perform the analysis as if _n_ is tending toward infinity, and in that scenario, the 500 is nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:**\n",
    "* The best complexity possible is **O(1)**, called \"constant time\" or \"constant space\". it means that the algorithm ALWAYS uses the same amount of resources, regardless of the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that a constant time complexity doesn't neccessarily mean that an algorithm is fast $(O(5000000) = O(1))$, it just means that it's runtime is independent of the input size. \n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "When talking about complexity, there are normally three cases:\n",

    "* Best case scenario \n",
    "* Average case \n",
    "* Worst case scenario \n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "In most algorithms, all three of these will be equal, but some algorithms will have them differ. If you have to choose only one to represent the algorithm's time or space complexity, never choose the best case scenario. It is most correct to use the worst case scenario, but you should be able to talk about the difference between the cases. \n",

With binary search, we initially consider the entire input ($n$ elements). After the first step, we only consider $n/2$ elements. After the second step, we only consider $n/4$ elements, and so on.

This means we have two integers, usually named something like `i` and `j` or `left` and `right` which each represent an `index` of the array or string.\n",

    "\n",
    "2) Use a `while loop` until the pointers are equal to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) At each iteration of the loop, move the pointers towards each other. This means either increment the pointer that start at the first index, decrement the pointer that started at the last index,, or both. Deciding which pointers to move will depend on the problem we are trying to solve. \n",

    "- The strength of this technique is that we will never have more than $O(n)$ iterations for the while loop because the pointers start $n$ away from each other and move at least one step closer in every iteration. Therefore, if we can keep the work inside each iteration at $O(1)$, this technique will result in a linear runtime, which is usually the best possible runtime. Let's look at some example:\n",

    "After reversing a string, the first character becomes the last character. If a string is the same after being reversed, that means the first character is the same as the last character, the second character is the same as the second last character, and so on. We can use the two pointers technique here to check that all corresponding characters are equal. To start, we check the first and last characters using two separate pointers. To check the next pair of characters, we just need to move our pointers toward each other one position. We continue until the pointers meet each other or we find a mismatch.\n",

To move on to the next pair, we move the left index forward by one, and the right index backward by one. Again, we check if the pair of characters are equal, and if they aren't, we return false.\n",

Algorithms are beautiful because of how abstract they are - \"two pointers\" is just an idea, and it can be implemented in many different ways. Let's look at another method and some new examples. The following method is capable when the problem has two iterables in the input, for example, two arrays. \n",

    "4) Because our while loop will stop when one of the pointers reaches the end, the other pointer will not be at the end of its respective iterable when the loop finishes. Sometimes, we need to iterate through all elements - if this is the case, you will need to write extra code here to make sure both iterables are exhausted. \n",

In that case, the time complexity of the sorting approach would be $O((n+m)⋅log(m+n))$ and the time complexity of the approach we are about to cover would be $O(n+m)$. It doesn't really make a difference, but one justification we could give here is that since we are combining the arrays, the total length is a significant number, so it makes sense to represent it as $n$.\n",

    "## Sliding Window\n",
    "Like **two pointers**, sliding windows work the same with arrays and strings - the important thing is that they're iterables with ordered elements. For the sake of brevity, the first part of this article up until the examples will be focusing on **arrays**. However, all the logic is identical for strings. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sliding window is another common approach to solving problems related to arrays. A sliding window is actually implemented using **two pointers**! Before we start, we need to talk about the concept of a **subarray**. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Subarrays\n",
    "Givern an array, a **subarray** is a contiguous section of the array. All the elements must be adjacent to each other in the original array and in their original order. For example, with the array `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the subarrays (grouped by length) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [1], [2], [3], [4]\n",
    "- [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]\n",
    "- [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4]\n",
    "- [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "**A subarray can be defined by two indices, the start and end**. For example, with `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the subarray `[2, 3]` has a starting index of `1` and an ending index of `2`. Let's call the starting index the **left bound** and the ending index the **right bound**. Another name for subarray in this context is `\"window\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When should we use sliding window?**\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a very common group of problems involving subarrays that can be solved efficiently with sliding window. Let's talk about how to identify this problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **first**, the problem will either explicitly or implicitly define criteria that make a subarray \"valid\". There are 2 components regarding what makes a subarray valid:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) A constraint metric. This is some attribute of a subarray. It could be the sum, the number of unique elements, the frequency of a specific element, or any other attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "2) A numeric restriction on the constraint metric. This is what the constraint metric should be for a subarray to be considered valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For example**, let's say a problem declares a subarray is valid if it has a sum less than or equal to `10`. The constraint metric here is the sum of the subarray, and the numeric restriction is `<= 10`. A subarray is considered valid if its constraint metric conforms to the numeric restriction, i.e. the sum is less than or equal to `10`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Second**, the problem will ask you to find valid subarrays in some way.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The most common task you will see is finding the best valid subarray. The problem will define what makes a subarray better than another. For example, a problem might ask you to find the **longest** valid subarray. \n",
    "\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Another common task is finding the number of valid subarrays. We will take a look at this later in the article. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Whenever a problem description talks about subarrays, you should figure out if sliding window is a good option by analyzing the problem description. If you can find the things mentioned above, then it's a good bet.\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here is a preview of some of the example problems that we will look at in this article, to help you better understand what sliding window problems look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Find the longest subarray with a sum less than or equal to `k`\n",
    "* Find the longest substing that has at most one `0`\n",
    "* Find the number of the subarrays that have a product less than `k`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind a sliding window is to consider **only** valid subarrays. Recall that a subarray can be defined by a left bound (the index of the first element) and a right bound (the index of the last element). In sliding window, we maintain two variables `left` and `right`, which at any given time represent the **current subarray** under consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, we have `left = right = 0`, which means that the first subarray we look at is just the first element of the array on its own. We want to expand the size of our `\"window\"`, and we do that by incrementing `right`. When we increment `right`, this is like \"adding\" a new element to our window.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if after adding a new element, the subarray becomes invalid? We need to \"remove\" some elements from our window until it becomes valid again. To \"remove\" elements, we can increment `left`, which shrinks our window.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we add and remove elements, we are `\"sliding\"` our window along the input from left to right. The window's size is constantly changing - it grows as large as it can until it's invalid, and then it shrinks. However, it always slides along to the right, until we reach the end of the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "To explain why this algorithm works, let's look at a specific example. Let's say that we are given a positive integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. We need to find the length of the longest subarray that has a sum less than or equal to `k`. For this example, let `nums = [3, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1]` and `k = 5`.\n",

    "Initially, we have `left = right = 0`, so our window is only the first element: `[3]`. Now, let's expand to the right until the constraint is broken. This will occur when `left = 0`, `right = 2`, and our window is: `[3, 2, 1]`. The sum here is `6`, which is greater than `k`. We must now shrink the window from the left until the constraint is no longer broken. After removing one element, the window becomes valid again: `[2, 1]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is it correct to remove this `3` and forget about it for the rest of the algorithm? Because the input only has positive integers, a longer subarray directly equals a larger sum. We know that `[3, 2, 1]` already results in a sum that is too large. There is no way for us to ever have a valid window again if we keep this `3` because if we were to add any more elements from the right, the sum would only get larger. That's why we can forget about the `3` for the rest of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation \n",
    "Now that you have an idea of how sliding window works, let's talk about how to implement it. For this section, we will use the previous example (find the longest subarray with a sum less than or equal to `k`).\n",
    "\n",
    "As described above, we need to identify a **constraint metric**. In our example, the constraint metric is the sum of the window. How do we keep track of the sum of the window as elements are added and removed? One way that we could do it is by keeping the window in a separate array. When we add elements from the right, we add them to our array. When we remove elements from the left, we remove the corresponding elements from the array. This way, we can always find the sum of our current window just by summing the elements in the separate array.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is very inefficient as removing elements and finding the sum of the window will be $O(n)$ operations. How can we do better?\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't actually need to store the window in a separate array. All we need is some variable, let's call it curr, that keeps track of the current sum. When we add a new element from the right, we just do `curr += nums[right]`. When we remove an element from the left, we just do `curr -= nums[left]`. This way, all operations are done in $O(1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, how do we move the pointers `left` and `right?` Remember, we want to keep expanding our window, and the window always slides to the right - it just might shrink a few times in between. Because `right` is always moving forward, we can use a `for loop` to iterate right over the input. In each iteration of the `for loop`, we will be `adding the element nums[right] to our window`.\n",
    "\n",
    "What about `left?` When we move `left`, we are shrinking our window. We only shrink our window when it becomes invalid. By maintaining `curr`, we can easily tell if the current window is valid by checking the condition `curr <= k`. When we add a new element and the window becomes invalid, we may need to remove multiple elements from the left. For example, let's say `nums = [1, 1, 1, 3]` and `k = 3`. When we arrive at the `3` and add it to the window, the window becomes invalid. We need to remove three elements from the left before the window becomes valid again.\n",
    "\n",
    "This suggests that we should use a while loop to perform the removals. The condition will be `while (curr > k)` (while the window is invalid). To perform the removals, we do `curr -= nums[left]` and then increment `left` in each iteration of the while loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, how do we update the answer? In each `for loop iteration`, after the `while loop`, the current window is valid. We can write code here to update the answer. **The formula for the length of a window is right - left + 1**.\n",

    "### Why is Sliding window efficient ?\n",
    "\n",
    "For any array, how many subarrays are there? If the array has a length of `n`, there are `n` subarrays of length `1`. Then there are `n - 1` subarrays of length `2` (every index except the last one can be a starting index), `n - 2` subarrays of length `3` and so on until there is only `1` subarray of length `n`. This means there are $\\sum_{k=1}^{n}k=\\frac{n.(n+1)}{2}$ subarrays (it's the partial sum of this [series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_%2B_2_%2B_3_%2B_4_%2B_%E2%8B%AF#Partial_sums)). In terms of time complexity, any algorithm that looks at every subarray will be at least $O(n^2)$, which is usually too slow. A sliding window guarantees a maximum of $2n$ window iterations - the right pointer can move $n$ times and the left pointer can move $n$ times. This means if the logic done for each window is $O(1)$, sliding window algorithms run in $O(n)$, which is **much** faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You may be thinking: there is a while loop inside of the for loop, isn't the time complexity $O(n^2)$? The reason it is still $O(n)$ is that the while loop can only iterate $n$ times in total for the entire algorithm (`left` starts at $0$, only increases, and never exceeds `n`). If the while loop were to run `n` times on one iteration of the for loop, that would mean it wouldn't run at all for all the other iterations of the for loop. This is what we refer to as [amortized analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amortized_analysis) - even though the worst case for an iteration inside the for loop is $O(n)$, it averages out to $O(1)$ when you consider the entire runtime of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Now let's look at some sliding window examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an array of positive integers `nums` and an integer `k`, find the length of the longest subarray whose sum is less than or equal to `k`. This is the problem we have been talking about above. We will now formally solve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use an integer `curr` that tracks the `sum` of the current window. Since the problem wants subarrays whose sum is less than or equal to `k`, we want to maintain `curr <= k`. Let's look at an example where `nums = [3, 1, 2, 7, 4, 2, 1, 1, 5`] and `k = 8`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The window starts empty, but we can grow it to `[3, 1, 2]` while maintaining the constraint. However, after adding the `7`, the window's sum becomes too large. We need to tighten the window until the sum is below `8` again, which doesn't happen until our window looks like `[7]`. When we try to add the next element, our window again becomes too large, and we need to remove the `7` which means we have `[4]`. We can now grow the window until it looks like `[4, 2, 1, 1]`, but adding the next element makes the sum too large. We remove elements from the left until it fits the constraint again, which happens at `[1, 1, 5]`. The longest subarray we found was `[4, 2, 1, 1]` which means the answer is `4`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we add an element to the window by moving the right bound, we just do `curr += value`. When we remove an element from the window by moving the left bound, we just do `curr -= value.` We should remove elements so long as `curr > k`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**More detailed explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize what each variable does in the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `left`: the leftmost index of our current window\n",
    "* `right`: the rightmost index of our current window\n",
    "* `curr`: the sum of our current window\n",
    "* `ans`: the length of the longest valid window we have seen so far\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterate `right` over the input to add elements to the window. Update `curr` by adding `nums[right]` to it. When the window becomes invalid `(curr > k)`, remove elements from the window by subtracting `nums[left]` from `curr`. Then increment `left`. We need to do this until the window becomes valid again, so we use a while loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "The size of a window is `right - left + 1`. Update our answer only when the window becomes valid.\n",

    "You are given a binary string `s` (a string containing only 0\" and \"1\"). You may choose up to one \"0\" and flip it to a \"1\". What is the length of the longest substring achievable that contains only \"1\" ?\n",

    "\n",
