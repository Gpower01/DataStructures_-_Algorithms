There are infinitely many of such arrays, and our algorithm works for **all** of them. Note that if `nums` had negative numbers, the input would be invalid since we stated the integers are positive. In fact, our algorithm would actually break because we initialized `maxNum` to 0, so if all of `nums` was negative, we would incorrectly output `0`.\n",

    "\n",
    "1) Time complexity - the amount of time the algorithms needs to run relative to input size\n",
    "2) Space complaxity - the amount of memory allocated by the algorithm relative to input size\n",

    "\n",
    "**Typically, people care about the time complexity more than the space complexity, but both are important to know**.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some common assumptions that we make. Wehen dealing with integers, the larger t he integer, the more time operations like addition, multiplication or printing will take. While this **is** relevant in theory, we typically ignore this fact because the difference is practically very small, and treat all integers the same. If you are given an array of integers as an input, the only variable you would ues is _n_ to denote the length of the array. Technically, you could introduce another variable, let's say _k_ which denotes the average value of the integers in the array. However, nobody does this. \n",

For example, we could have a problem where the input is two arrays. _n_ could denote the length of one while _m_ denotes the length of the other.\n",

    "**Calculating complexity**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the above example (find the largest number in `nuums`), we have a time complexity of **O(n)**. The algorithm involves iterating over each elements in `nums`, so if we define _n_ as the length of `nums`, ou algorithm uses approximately _n_ steps. If we pass an array with a length of `10`, it will perform approximately `10` steps. If we pass an array with a length of `10,000,000,000`, it will perform approximately `10,000,000,000` steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:**\n",
    "- Being able to analyze an algorithm and calculate it's time and space complexity is a crucial skill. Interviewers will **almost always** ask you for your algorithm's complexity to check that you actually understand your algorithm and didn't just memorize/copy the code. Being able to analyze an algorithm also enables you to determine what parts of it can be improved. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rules**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few rules when it comes to calculating complexity. First, **we ignore constants**. That means $O(9999999n) = O(8n) = O(n) = O(\\frac{n}{500})$. Why do we do this? Imagine you had two algorithms. Algorithm A uses approximately _n_ operations and algorithm B uses approximately _5n_ operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "When _n_ = 100, algorithm A uses 100 operations and algorithm B uses 500 operations. What happens if we double _n_ ? Then algorithm A uses 200 operations and algorithm B uses 1000 operations. As you can see, When we double the value of _n_, both algorithms require double the amount of operations. If we were to _10x_ the value of _n_, then both algorithms would require _10x_ more operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember: the point of complexity is to analyze the algorithm **as the input changes**. We don't care that algorithm B is _5x_ slower than algorithm A. For both algorithms, as the input size increases, the number of operations required increases **linearly**. That's what we care about. Thus, both algorithms are **O(n)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The second rule is that we consider the complexity as the variables **tend to infinity**. When we have additions/subtraction between terms of the **same variable, we ignore all terms except the most powerful one**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, $O(2^{n} + n^{2} - 500) = O(2^{n})$. Why? Because as _n_ tends to infinity, $2^{n}$ becomes so large that the other two terms are effectively zero in comparison. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that we had an algorithm that required _n_ + 500 operations. It has a time complexity of $O(n)$. When _n_ is small, let's say n = 5, the +500 term is very significant - but we don't care about that. We need to perform the analysis as if _n_ is tending toward infinity, and in that scenario, the 500 is nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:**\n",
    "* The best complexity possible is **O(1)**, called \"constant time\" or \"constant space\". it means that the algorithm ALWAYS uses the same amount of resources, regardless of the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that a constant time complexity doesn't neccessarily mean that an algorithm is fast $(O(5000000) = O(1))$, it just means that it's runtime is independent of the input size. \n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "When talking about complexity, there are normally three cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Best case scenario \n",
    "* Average case \n",
    "* Worst case scenario \n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "In most algorithms, all three of these will be equal, but some algorithms will have them differ. If you have to choose only one to represent the algorithm's time or space complexity, never choose the best case scenario. It is most correct to use the worst case scenario, but you should be able to talk about the difference between the cases. \n",

With binary search, we initially consider the entire input ($n$ elements). After the first step, we only consider $n/2$ elements. After the second step, we only consider $n/4$ elements, and so on.
